# -Telecom_Churn_Prediction
This repository contains a telecom customer churn prediction project, developed as a group effort for a Kaggle competition. The project focused on predicting which customers are at risk of leaving the company, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The models were designed to predict churn probabilities, helping to identify at-risk customers effectively. The group also generated valuable insights to enhance customer retention strategies, aiming to reduce the costs associated with customer turnover. The repository includes the complete codebase, data preprocessing steps, model development, and evaluation metrics, offering a comprehensive solution for churn prediction in the telecom industry.
